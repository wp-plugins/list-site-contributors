List site contributors and authors. 

== Description ==

List site contributors allows you list your site's contributors and authors. 
Just add the shortcode [listsitecontributors] to a page on your blog. 
Optionally you can use the User Photo Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/) for images,  
otherwise Avatars will be used.

== Installation ==

1. Extract and upload this directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

This shows a listing of active contributors and authors with images with an A-Z directory and last name search.

= What if I do not have the User Photo Plugin? =

This will use the User Photo Plugin image, if installed. Otherwise the Wordpress Avatar image will be used. 

= Where are the options? =

Option yes/no for showing the web link url for the listed authors/contributors.
Option number of characters to limit the authors and contributors descriptions on the search results. Default is 150 chars.

= Any other notes? =

If you are logged in as admin, you will see the full descriptions of authors and contributors.
This allows search plugins like Relevanssi to get all that information. Logout to see the normal user view.
