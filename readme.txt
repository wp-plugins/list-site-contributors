== Description ==

List site contributors allows you list your site's contributors and authors. 
Just add the shortcode [listsitecontributors] to a page on your blog. 
Optionally you can use the User Photo Plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/) for images,  
otherwise Avatars will be used.

== Installation ==

1. Extract and upload this directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
